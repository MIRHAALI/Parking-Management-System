# Parking-Management-System
This Java-based Parking Management System utilizes Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to efficiently manage parking spaces. Featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI), it allows users to interactively view and manage parking slots in real-time. Key functionalities include dynamic slot allocation, vehicle search and retrieval using optimized algorithms, and a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. Ideal for understanding DSA applications in real-world scenarios and GUI development in Java."
